### How long does the Earth (or any planet) take to go once around the Sun?

In celestial mechanics the time it takes a body to complete one revolution around the Sun is called its **orbital period**.  
For Earth that period is what we normally call a “year”.  
Let’s unpack the different ways we measure a year, how the value is derived, and why it isn’t a perfectly constant number.

## 1. The basic fact: the sidereal year

- **Sidereal year** – the time between two successive crossings of the same point in the sky (the same fixed stars).  
- **Value**: 365.256363004 days
  - 365 days + 6 h 9 m 9 s (≈ 6.15 h)

The sidereal year is the true orbital period of Earth relative to the Sun. It is the period that comes straight out of Newton’s laws (or Kepler’s laws) when you plug in Earth’s average distance from the Sun.

## 2. Why we also use the tropical year

- **Tropical year** – the interval between successive vernal equinoxes (the moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north).
- **Value**: 365.2421897 days
  - 365 days + 5 h 48 m 45 s (≈ 5.78 h)

The tropical year is the basis for our calendar because the seasons repeat with respect to the equinoxes. It is **shorter** than the sidereal year by about 20 minutes (≈ 0.014 days). That difference is caused by the **precession of the equinoxes**: the Earth’s axis slowly wobbles, shifting the location of the equinoxes relative to the stars.

## 3. Anomalistic year

- **Anomalistic year** – the interval between successive perihelia (the point where Earth is closest to the Sun).
- **Value**: 365.259636 days

This period is slightly longer than the sidereal year because the elliptical shape of Earth’s orbit causes the orbital speed to change (Kepler’s second law). Gravitational perturbations from other planets also shift the exact moment of perihelion.

## 4. Where the 365‑day number comes from

Kepler’s Third Law (in modern form) states:

\[
P^{2} = a^{3}
\]

where
- \(P\) is the orbital period in Earth years,
- \(a\) is the semi‑major axis in astronomical units (AU).

For Earth, \(a = 1.000\,000\,AU\), so

\[
P^{2} = 1^{3} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; P = 1 \text{ year}
\]

The year is defined as the time it takes to complete one orbit, so by construction Earth’s orbital period equals one year. The small deviations from an exact 365‑day count come from:

1. **Eccentricity of the orbit** (≈ 0.0167).
2. **Solar mass variations** (tiny mass loss from the Sun due to radiation).
3. **Gravitational tugs** from other planets (especially Jupiter).
4. **General relativistic corrections** (≈ 1.7 seconds per orbit).

All of these effects shift the orbital period by fractions of a second or minutes over centuries.

## 5. How we measure the year

| Method | Principle | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Astronomical observations of stars** (sidereal) | Track Earth’s position relative to the fixed background stars | ± 0.01 s over decades |
| **Equinox timing** (tropical) | Note the time of the vernal equinox (Sun’s apparent motion) | ± 0.1 s |
| **Computer ephemerides** | Integrate planetary motions with modern physics | ± 0.001 s |

The Gregorian calendar (the one we use today) is based on the tropical year. It corrects for the 20‑minute difference by inserting a leap day every four years, except for century years that are not divisible by 400.

## 6. Orbital periods of other planets

| Planet | Orbital period (sidereal year) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Mercury | 87.969 days |
| Venus   | 224.701 days |
| Earth   | 365.256 days |
| Mars    | 686.971 days |
| Jupiter | 4,333.5 days (~11.86 years) |
| Saturn  | 10,759.2 days (~29.46 years) |
| Uranus  | 30,685.4 days (~84.01 years) |
| Neptune | 60,190.0 days (~164.79 years) |

Notice that the period grows roughly with the **cube** of the semi‑major axis: \(P \propto a^{3/2}\). This is a direct consequence of Kepler’s third law.

## 7. Summary

- **Earth’s true orbital period** ≈ **365.256 days** (sidereal year).
- **Calendar year** ≈ **365.242 days** (tropical year) to keep seasons aligned.
- The difference (~20 minutes) is due to axial precession.
- Orbital mechanics (Kepler’s laws) and modern ephemerides give us the precise value.
- Other planets have longer or shorter periods according to their distance from the Sun.

So when you hear “a year” we’re really talking about Earth’s ~365‑day orbit around the Sun, measured either relative to the stars (sidereal) or relative to the seasons (tropical).
